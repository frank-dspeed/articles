# Thanks to CanJS and DoneJS Core Team and What the Project mean for me

This is a big Thanks to the Bitovi Frontend Team

- CanJS + DoneJS was the most encapsulated best frontend Framework i found
- The Bitovi Frontend Dev Core Contributors and other workers are Really Smart
- I learnd a lot from all this people
- Special Thanks to Kevin Philips
- Justin B. Myer
- Julien 
- Prachant
- Chasen Le Harra 
- Sorry names need correction maybe this is a pre write up

All this people Made Nils happen even if i writed it alone i depend strong on this guys
because they was the first who did JavaScript MVC and CanJS even React is not that smart

React had some good ideas also like using JSX but that it all else was better from CanJS
and CanJS was always more encapsulated in Frontend Stuff.

It got a Nice encapsulating system.

The Time has come now for Nils bundling all the new tech and leaving CanJS as the Legacy Compatible Style of Coding WebComponents
They started working on load optimization and that is a layer that i don't want to take as in future this is solved diffrent.
The CanJS Project needs to support many old Browsers thats why its still well for legacy Compatible stuff.

But over time the Amount of pollyfill methods will grow and CanJS can be droped Complet. I expect that State to be Reached in the next 2 Years for people that really need to support old browsers.
